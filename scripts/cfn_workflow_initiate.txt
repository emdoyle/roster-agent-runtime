<narrative title="Github Issue Causes Workflow Initiation">
<purpose>
When an Issue is created in the Github repository where Roster is installed, the ImplementFeature workflow
should be initiated with the purpose of implementing the changes requested in the Issue.
</purpose>
<step title="Receive Issue Creation Webhook">
<description>
Roster receives a webhook payload from Github indicating that an Issue has been created.
</description>
</step>
<step title="Handle Issue Creation">
<description>
The Issue creation payload is handled by the RosterGithubApp, which prepares the associated Workspace and uses
the WorkflowService to initiate the 'ImplementFeature' workflow. Finally, the RosterGithubApp uses the GithubService to
leave a comment on the Issue indicating that work has begun.

</step>
<step title="Send Workflow Initiation Message">
<description>
The WorkflowService receives inputs intended for the ImplementFeature workflow, and prepares the associated JSON message
to deliver to the WorkflowRouter via RabbitMQ.
</description>
</step>
<step title="Handle Workflow Initiation Message">
<description>
When the WorkflowRouter receives a Workflow Initiation message, it creates the associated WorkflowRecord to hold state
about workflow execution. Then it determines which Actions in the workflow should be triggered, and sends messages to the
appropriate Agents to trigger those Actions.
